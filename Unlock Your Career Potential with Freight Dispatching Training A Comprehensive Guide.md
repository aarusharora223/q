## What is Freight Dispatching?

At its core, freight dispatching is the process of coordinating the movement of goods from point A to point B.  Dispatchers act as intermediaries between shippers who need to transport goods and carriers (trucking companies or independent owner-operators) who have the vehicles and capacity to do so.

A freight dispatcher's responsibilities are multifaceted and often include:

*   **Finding Loads:**  This involves actively searching load boards, contacting shippers directly, and utilizing their network to identify available freight that matches the carrier's equipment and preferences.
*   **Negotiating Rates:**  Dispatchers negotiate rates with shippers to ensure fair compensation for the carrier while also remaining competitive.
*   **Route Planning:**  Optimizing routes to minimize fuel costs, transit time, and potential delays.
*   **Compliance:** Ensuring drivers and carriers comply with all relevant regulations, including hours of service, safety standards, and permits.
*   **Tracking and Communication:**  Monitoring the progress of shipments, communicating updates to shippers and carriers, and resolving any issues that may arise.
*   **Paperwork Management:** Handling all necessary documentation, including bills of lading, contracts, and invoices.
