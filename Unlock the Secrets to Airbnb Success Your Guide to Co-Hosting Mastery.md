## What is Airbnb Co-Hosting?

Airbnb co-hosting is a partnership where a property owner (the host) enlists the help of another individual (the co-host) to manage their Airbnb listing and guest interactions. The co-host essentially handles the day-to-day operations, freeing up the homeowner to focus on other aspects of their life.

**Responsibilities of an Airbnb Co-Host can include:**

*   **Creating and Optimizing Listings:** Crafting compelling descriptions, taking high-quality photos, and setting competitive pricing.
*   **Guest Communication:** Responding to inquiries, managing bookings, and providing pre-arrival information.
