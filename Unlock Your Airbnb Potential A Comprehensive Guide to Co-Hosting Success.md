## What is Airbnb Co-Hosting?

Co-hosting is essentially a partnership where a property owner (the host) enlists the help of another individual or company (the co-host) to manage their Airbnb listing. The co-host typically handles day-to-day tasks, allowing the property owner to enjoy the benefits of Airbnb income without the burden of constant management. The responsibilities of a co-host can vary depending on the agreement with the property owner, but they generally include:

*   **Guest Communication:** Responding to inquiries, managing bookings, and providing excellent customer service throughout the guest's stay.
*   **Listing Management:** Creating and optimizing the Airbnb listing, including writing compelling descriptions, taking high-quality photos, and setting competitive pricing.
